# my_unit
My implementation of the SHVN -> MNIST domain adaptation model of the [Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00848.pdf) paper.

This implementation is in TensorFlow and is based on the author's [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/mingyuliutw/UNIT).

# Status
### 27 January 2018
I have trained the model for 909 epochs and the highest accuracy is around 13%.
